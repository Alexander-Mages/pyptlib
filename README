- What is pyptlib?

pyptlib is a little Python library which understands the 'pluggable
transport managed-proxy protocol' [0].

- Who is interested in pyptlib?

You might be interested in pyptlib if you have an application that
obfuscates TCP traffic and you want to integrate it easily with Tor.

- What does pyptlib do?

When pyptlib is initialized by your application, pyptlib communicates
with Tor and learns which pluggable transports Tor needs, in which
ports you should listen for connections, in which filesystem directory
you should keep state, etc.
Pyptlib then reports that information to your application and your
application has to follow Tor's wishes.

- How do I use pyptlib?

Read the API file and see the examples/ directory. The source code
might also be useful.
